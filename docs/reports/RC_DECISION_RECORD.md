## Recommendation

- Current recommendation: `No-go`
- Rationale:

1. Signed CI gate is functioning correctly but blocked by missing required `APPLE_*` secrets.
2. Signed artifact verification and signed smoke are both blocked by the missing-secrets prerequisite.
3. Engineering and security baselines are stable, so remaining work is isolated to signing/notarization closure.

## Open Blockers

1. Configure required `APPLE_*` secrets in repository settings.
2. Re-run signed release workflow (`channel=qa`, `require_signed=true`) and collect signing + notarization evidence.
3. Execute signed critical-path smoke checklist on the signed artifact.
4. Re-run `npm run phase4:gates`; update this record to `Go` only if all required signed gates pass.

## Execution Notes (2026-02-22)

1. Command: `gh pr view 12 -R saagar210/auraforge --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit`
   - Result: PR merged at `2026-02-22T11:41:01Z`; merge commit `09b4add63251e18d35d4c08cb8d21881339192cb`.
2. Command: `gh workflow list -R saagar210/auraforge --json name,path,state`
   - Result: `release-rc` workflow is active on default branch.
3. Command: `gh secret list -R saagar210/auraforge --json name,updatedAt`
   - Result: `[]` (required `APPLE_*` secrets missing).
4. Command: `gh workflow run release-rc.yml -R saagar210/auraforge --ref main -f channel=qa -f require_signed=true`
   - Result: latest run `22276721898` failed early with missing-secrets enforcement.
5. Command: `gh workflow run release-rc.yml -R saagar210/auraforge --ref main -f channel=qa -f require_signed=false`
   - Result: run `22276565971` succeeded; unsigned artifact uploaded.
6. Command: `bash .codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh`, `npm audit --json`, `npm run phase4:gates`
   - Result: engineering and security lanes pass; release prerequisite lane fails due missing secrets.
