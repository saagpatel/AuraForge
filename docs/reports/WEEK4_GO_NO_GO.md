## Decision

- Recommendation: `No-go`
- Week 5 path: `Track B (remediation sprint)`
- Decision rationale:

1. Signed release gate is still blocked by missing required Apple secrets.
2. Without a signed artifact, signature/notarization and signed smoke gates cannot run.
3. Engineering and security lanes are stable, so Week 5 should focus narrowly on signing closure and signed smoke completion.
